    Fills in every cell except the four corners with random playing cards. Setups the test to
    prepare for strategy 2 to verify that it plays to the correct corner. The grid size is a 3x3.

MockModelStrategy1 class:
    GRID BEFORE STRATEGY:
        CCXX
        CXCX
        CXXX
        CXXX

    GRID AFTER STRATEGY:
        CCXX
        CCCX
        CXXX
        CXXX
    Fills in the entire first row with random playing cards as well as placing a card within the
    second row and last column. Setups the test to prepare for strategy 1 to verify that it plays
    to the grid tile to result in the most number of cards flipped. The grid size is 3x3.


As well as mocks, we created numerous environments for our tests to test then with asserted. We
created various card/board configurations and played the ThreeTrios game within the test until the
desired point to perform our test at. These assertions have a majority of our strategy tests. The
expected HashMap<Point, Integer> works by having the Point object to represent the position on the
grid while the Integer object represents the card index to play to that position.
